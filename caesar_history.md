## Ceaser Cipher
# Historical context

When was this cipher used? Who used it?

Your final presentation should be given to the class as a github repo with visuals and supporting information. This is a big assignment so be prepared to answer questions and give a complete picture of the cipher, it's use, and historical context.

Create a fork of the project repo, all of your files should be named the first name of your cipher and then the purpose (caesar_history.md). Create links to the other 4 pages (the first page is historical context), make sure all the links work, then start working on the research. Donâ€™t Merge or do a Pull Request until we do it together.
