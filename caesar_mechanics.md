# Ceaser-Cipher
## Mechanics

### How does the cipher work? 
It is quite easy to encode, concidering when this cipher was made. They didn't have a need for such an advance cipher when barely anyone was literate. The way the cipher works is just by shifting alphabetical letter to the left or right for a fixed amount. Caesar would typically move the letters 3 to the left

### Demo an encryption and decryption. Is it symmetric, does the same process decrypt as encrypt?

Your final presentation should be given to the class as a github repo with visuals and supporting information. This is a big assignment so be prepared to answer questions and give a complete picture of the cipher, it's use, and historical context.

Create a fork of the project repo, all of your files should be named the first name of your cipher and then the purpose (caesar_history.md). Create links to the other 4 pages (the first page is historical context), make sure all the links work, then start working on the research. Donâ€™t Merge or do a Pull Request until we do it together.
