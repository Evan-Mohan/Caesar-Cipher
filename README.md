# Ceaser-Cipher

Final analysis

Why did this stop being a useful code? What made it useful when it was being used? What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?

Your final presentation should be given to the class as a github repo with visuals and supporting information. This is a big assignment so be prepared to answer questions and give a complete picture of the cipher, it's use, and historical context.

Create a fork of the project repo, all of your files should be named the first name of your cipher and then the purpose (caesar_history.md). Create links to the other 4 pages (the first page is historical context), make sure all the links work, then start working on the research. Donâ€™t Merge or do a Pull Request until we do it together.
