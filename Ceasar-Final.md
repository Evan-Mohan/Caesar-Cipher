# Final Analysis
### Why did this stop being a useful code?
Caesar Ciphers only have 25 possible keys. This means caesar ciphers are very prone to brute force attacks. A human with a lot of paitence and time would be 
able to crack the message, but computers could crack it very easily. So the Caesar cipher is no longer a secure cipher.

### What made it useful when it was being used?
The cipher was created in 100 BC by Julius Caesar. He used the cipher to send coded messasges to soldiers. If the messages were intercepted the opposing generals 
wouldn't be able to read or understand the message. The cipher was quite useful in a time long before computers.
### What are other interesting uses of this code or similar code?
The Caesar cipher is simple and easy to understand. It is an easy way to teach students the basics of encryption, ciphers and keys. 
It could also be used between friends in games as it is so simple to make and could be fun.
